# Nvim Config
To copy this config just go to `~/.config/`

There you need to clone the Repo with `git clone https://github.com/Maduki-tech/nvim.git nvim `

This will get you the Repo with the right path.

After this you need to remove the Plugins folder with `rm -rf plugin`

## Install the Config in your Neovim

1. Open the file in **./lua/maduki/init.lua** 
2. There you need to run `:PackerSync`
3. Restart NeoVim now and everything should be working
